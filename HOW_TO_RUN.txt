How to Run IOC Auto Analysis

Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Internet connection
- VirusTotal API keys (multiple keys recommended for rate limiting)
- AbuseIPDB API key (optional, for IP reputation data)

Setup

1. Configure API Keys
   - Open api_keys.txt
   - Add your VirusTotal API keys (one per line)
   - Add your AbuseIPDB API key on the last line
   - Format example:
     # VirusTotal API Keys
     your_vt_key_1
     your_vt_key_2
     your_vt_key_3
     # AbuseIPDB API Key
     your_abuseipdb_key

2. Prepare IoC Input
   - Open ioc_input.csv
   - Add IoCs in the "IoCs" column (one per row)
   - Supported IoC types:
     * IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
     * Domains (e.g., example.com)
     * URLs (e.g., https://example.com/path)
     * File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
     * Email addresses (will be skipped with warning)
   - Save the file

3. Run the Scanner
   - Double-click run_scanner.bat
   - The script will:
     * Validate prerequisites
     * Process each IoC through VirusTotal API
     * Query AbuseIPDB for IP addresses
     * Display progress bar
     * Generate output files

Output Files (in results/ folder)
- results/json/virustotal_results.json - Raw VirusTotal API responses
- results/csvs/virustotal_results.csv - Formatted VirusTotal data
- results/json/abuseipdb_results.json - Raw AbuseIPDB responses (IPs only)
- results/csvs/abuseipdb_results.csv - Formatted AbuseIPDB data (IPs only)
- debug_log.txt - Detailed scan logs and errors
- scan_progress.txt - Progress tracking (auto-deleted)

Features
- Automatic IoC type detection
- Multiple API key rotation for rate limiting
- Progress tracking with visual bar
- Error handling and logging
- CSV and JSON output formats
- AbuseIPDB integration for IP reputation

Notes
- Rate limiting: 4 requests per key before rotation
- 2-second delay between requests
- Email IoCs are skipped (not supported by VT API)
- Invalid IoCs are logged and skipped

- Results are organized in results/ subdirectories
